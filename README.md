# MongoDB $unwind Stage Error with Empty Arrays in $lookup Result

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `$unwind` stage in MongoDB aggregation pipelines after a `$lookup` operation.  The issue arises when the `$lookup` results in an empty array for some documents.  The standard `$unwind` operation will fail in such cases, while setting `preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: true` prevents the error.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that handles empty arrays gracefully.

## Setup:

1.  Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running.
2.  Create two collections, "collectionA" and "collectionB", with appropriate data for testing.
3.  Run the provided JavaScript code.

## Summary:

This example highlights the importance of carefully considering the possibility of empty arrays when using `$unwind` and how the `preserveNullAndEmptyArrays` option should be used to avoid errors and ensure robust aggregation pipelines.
