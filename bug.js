```javascript
const pipeline = [
  {
    $lookup:
      {
        from: "collectionB",
        localField: "_id",
        foreignField: "foreignKey",
        as: "results"
      }
  },
  {
    $unwind:
      {
        path: "$results",
        preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: true //this is the line causing the issue
      }
  }
];

//This aggregation pipeline gives the correct result,but when you replace the preserveNullAndEmptyArrays value with false or remove the line completely,it gives an error stating that the $unwind failed to unwind an empty array
//The query works perfectly without the unwind stage,but when the unwind stage is added it throws an error.

// This is because in MongoDB, the $unwind stage will fail if it encounters an empty array. If the "results" array is empty for any document in collectionA, the aggregation pipeline will fail with an error. The preserveNullAndEmptyArrays option will prevent this from occurring.
