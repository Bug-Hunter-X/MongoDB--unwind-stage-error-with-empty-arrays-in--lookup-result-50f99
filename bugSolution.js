```javascript
const pipeline = [
  {
    $lookup:
      {
        from: "collectionB",
        localField: "_id",
        foreignField: "foreignKey",
        as: "results"
      }
  },
  {
    $unwind:
      {
        path: "$results",
        preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: true
      }
  }
];

//This aggregation pipeline gives the correct result even if the results array is empty
//The preserveNullAndEmptyArrays option is crucial for handling scenarios where the $lookup operation may return empty arrays. Without it, the $unwind operation would fail.
